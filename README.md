# evol
A Unity project inspired by the evolution program in "The Blind Watchmaker" by Richard Dawkins.

You can download it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3awpsZxDZ3mZlFadHNwTk5tMjA/view). 
Just make sure you have the data folder in the same folder as the exe, and run the exe. 

Click the restart button to restart, or the "X" to close the program.

When you run the program, it starts at the simplest fractal. That is, a fractal with genes 0,0,0. 
Every generation, one of those genes is incremented by one. 
The genes affect the thickness of the branches, the angle at which they branch, and the number of times they branch.
Once you have arrived at the most complex fractal, the simulation ends. You can click restart to begin again.
